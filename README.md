# PrisimAI

PrisimAI is a progressive web app (PWA) that lets you chat with models powered by Pollinations.ai. Itâ€™s designed to look sleek, run fast, and stay usable even when offline. Once installed, PrisimAI behaves like a native app on desktop or mobile, complete with icons, splash screens, and offline support.

## âœ¨ Features

- Chat Interface â€“ Seamless, modern chat UI built with Tailwind CSS.
- Model Selection â€“ Choose different AI models from Pollinations API.
- PWA Support â€“ Installable on desktop and mobile, with offline caching.
- Offline Mode â€“ Displays a custom offline page when thereâ€™s no internet, styled to match the site theme with a retry button.
- Theming â€“ Colors and fonts configured for a clean, modern experience.
- Cross-Platform Support â€“ Works on Chrome, Edge, Safari, and mobile browsers.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prisimai.git
cd prisimai
```

### 2. Add Icons
Place your generated icons in the /icons folder.

**Required:** icon-192.png and icon-512.png

*Optional:* Apple Touch Icon (apple-touch-icon.png) and favicons

If you donâ€™t already have icons, you can generate them using a favicon generator (e.g. favicon.io).

### 3. Run Locally
You need a local server to test service workers (they donâ€™t run from file://).

*Quick option: use Pythonâ€™s HTTP server:*
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080
```

### 4. Offline Page Styling
When you are offline, PrisimAI will show a dedicated offline page matching the dark theme of the app, with a concise message and a retry button.

This is cached by the service worker and does not require internet access to display.
