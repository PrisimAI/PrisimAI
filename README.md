# PrisimAI

PrisimAI is a progressive web app (PWA) that lets you chat with models powered by Pollinations.ai. Itâ€™s designed to look sleek, run fast, and stay usable even when offline. Once installed, PrisimAI behaves like a native app on desktop or mobile, complete with icons, splash screens, and offline support.

## âœ¨ Features

- Chat Interface â€“ Seamless, modern chat UI built with Tailwind CSS.
- Model Selection â€“ Choose different AI models from Pollinations API.
- PWA Support â€“ Installable on desktop and mobile, with offline caching.
- Offline Mode â€“ Displays a custom offline page when thereâ€™s no internet.
- Theming â€“ Colors and fonts configured for a clean, modern experience.
- Cross-Platform Support â€“ Works on Chrome, Edge, Safari, and mobile browsers.
- **Dynamic Style Updates** â€“ Change and persist CSS theme variables directly from the app.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prisimai.git
cd prisimai
```

### 2. Add Icons
Place your generated icons in the /icons folder.
**Required:** icon-192.png and icon-512.png
*Optional:* Apple Touch Icon (apple-touch-icon.png) and favicons
If you donâ€™t already have icons, you can generate them using a favicon generator (e.g. favicon.io).

### 3. Run Locally
You need a local server to test service workers.
#### Python 3
```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

### 4. Change Styles at Runtime
PrisimAI allows you to modify theme colors, fonts, and other CSS variables without redeploying:
```js
import { setStyle, resetStyle } from './dev/styleManager.js';
setStyle('primary-color', '#ff6600'); // changes primary color
resetStyle('primary-color'); // resets to default
```
Your style changes persist across sessions via localStorage.
